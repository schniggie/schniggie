Do detailed research on the techstack and then create a researchstack.md document - this document should contain all code snippets, versions, everything - you must use the latest versions and the latest documentation from context7 at all times. A lot 
has potentially changed since you were trained so make sure to do detailed research on documentation. Then be very careful with what is server side and what is client side, remember to use 'use client' when needed, don't use server side calls in client code etc. 

DO NOT MAKE ANY ASSUMPTIONS WHEN CREATING THE .MD FILES - YOU MUST ADHERE TO EXACTLY WHAT YOU FIND INSIDE CONTEXT7 - COMMANDS, VERSIONS, ETC ARE VITAL TO THIS - DO NOT GO OFF YOUR OWN KNOWLEDGE AT ANY POINT AND FOLLOW EXACTLY WHAT IS FOUND INSIDE CONTEXT7 WITH GREAT LEVELS OF ACCURACY

Make sure to give me a detailed design plan and add that to design.md

Before making any coding decisions, always check researchstack.md and design.md

<system>linux / windows / shell</system>
<application>FastHTML app</application>
<techstack>MonsterUI</techstack>
<client>Company xyz selling xyz</client>
<details>
  <landingpagve />
  <products>xyz</products>
  <history />
  <contact />
</details>
<folder>"C:\Users\xyz\project\public"</folder>
<languages>British English, Italian</languages>

You must use Context7 MCP in order to research all relevant documentation first - you must use only the official documentation of a website

Build me a fully functioning <application /> for a <client />

Use <techstack />

I'm on <system /> so make sure all commands use the correct snytax
